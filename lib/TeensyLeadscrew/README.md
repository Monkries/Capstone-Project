# TeensyLeadscrew Library (and friends)

This is the backbone of the project, and it's designed to be extremely user-friendly, and easy to use in your own "frontends."

The TeensyLeadscrew class is the main thing you'll want to interact with, and it's meant to "feel" a lot like using traditional lathe controls (specifically patterned after Hardinge HLV-H's feed clutch system).
