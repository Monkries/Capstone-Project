# Capstone-Project
The lathe is arguably the most important machine tool in engineering history, and one of its defining features is the ability to cut threads. For hundreds of years, this has been accomplished by using gears to link the movement of the cutting tool to the movement of the spinning workpiece. To cut finer or coarser threads, the machinist must vary this gear ratio.This system works, but it has limitations. It is poorly suited for small benchtop machines, because the gearbox parts end up extremely small and expensive to manufacture. It is also inconvenient to adjust; the machinist must read a chart and physically add and remove gears from the geartrain. On larger lathes, this inconvenience is reduced using a simple transmission, allowing the machinist to shift several levers according to a chart, but this is more expensive, and more difficult to scale down to smaller machines.This project aims to replace this gearbox with electronics. This will eliminate the need to physically move gears around to adjust the system; instead, machinists will simply type in the desiredthread pitch into the control panel. Additionally, this system will be much more cost-effective and accessible on small benchtop lathes, where the traditional gearbox approach is impractical.
